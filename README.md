## 🎯 Introduction
This project uses AutoGluon for risk classification and Phi-2 for explainability in fraud detection. It automates risk assessment based on financial metrics, transaction behaviors, and anomalies, predicting risk levels (Low, Medium, High) while providing AI-driven explanations for transparency.

## 💡 Inspiration
The project was inspired by the need for automated, transparent risk assessment in financial fraud detection. Traditional methods struggle with scalability and interpretability, making it difficult to identify high-risk entities effectively. By leveraging AutoGluon for classification and Phi-2 for explainability, this system enhances fraud detection by providing both accurate risk predictions and clear, AI-generated reasoning.

## ⚙️ What It Does
This project automates risk assessment by:
- Predicting risk levels using AutoGluon on financial and transactional data.
- Computing a risk score based on multiple factors like jurisdiction, anomalies, and transaction behaviors.
- Generating AI-driven explanations with Phi-2 to provide reasoning for the risk classification.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
- AutoGluon was used to train a risk classification model on financial and transactional data.
- A risk scoring algorithm was designed, incorporating jurisdiction, anomalies, and transaction behaviors.
- Phi-2 LLM generates explanations for the predicted risk levels.
- User inputs are processed, risk scores are calculated, and predictions are made in real-time.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
- Handling inconsistencies, missing values, and discrepancies between different data sources, which can impact model performance.
- Managing the increased computational cost and complexity of risk analysis while ensuring scalability.
- Defining an effective risk scoring methodology that balances multiple risk factors, including financial metrics, transaction behaviors, jurisdictional risks, and anomalies.
- Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of risk classification models to minimize false positives and false negatives.
- Generating reliable explanations using LLMs while avoiding hallucinations and ensuring interpretability in high-stakes fraud detection.
